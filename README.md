# KlexAI

KlexAI is a closed-source AI language model (LLM) developed by me. I have created a version of KlexAI that integrates with Roblox Studio as a free plugin.

## Usage

To use the API, you need an account with an active EndM subscription. The pricing model is pay-per-use rather than token-based, which makes it more cost-effective.

## Notes

- AI responses may be delayed because the current server infrastructure is not optimized for low latency.
- I plan to invest in more powerful servers in the future if the AI becomes profitable.
