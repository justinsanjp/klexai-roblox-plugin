# KlexAI

KlexAI is a closed-source AI language model (LLM) developed by me. I have created a version of KlexAI that integrates with Roblox Studio as a free plugin.

## Usage

To use the API, you need an account with an active subscription plan. The pricing model is not pay-per-use and not token-based, which makes it more cost-effective For you.

## Notes

- AI responses may be delayed because the current server infrastructure is not optimized for low latency.
- I plan to invest in more powerful servers in the future if the AI becomes profitable.
- Pricing model can change in the future!
